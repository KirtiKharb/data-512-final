        "Mental health has become a serious concern in the 21st century. As people in technical jobs lead a sedentary lifestyle and have very few social engagements outside their workplace, It is important to study the factors in a workplace that affect an individual’s mental health. I want to know how employers can take measures to promote their employee’s mental health and spread awareness to address this growing concern. Aside from company policies with regard to health, leaves, insurance, etc., the ability to comfortably communicate health problems with colleagues and supervisors can have a serious impact on an employee’s mental health.

        "The Mental Health in Tech Survey data is skewed in the sense that the majority of survey participants are from the US and very few from low-income countries. The survey has answers from 1259 participants about 26 questions. The small sample size and skewness will create problems in making any strong claims on whether the region/country affects the mental health of people working there. It does not appear that the survey was administered to a representative sample and so, we won't be able to generalize the findings to a broader population. Also, as it is qualitative data, the analysis will heavily depend on the range of options for each categorical question. There might not be sufficient objectivity and also some bias in data collection steps. The variable, treatment (Have you sought treatment for a mental health condition?) may not be representative of the fact that whether individual suffers from a mental illness. "
